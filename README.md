# Description of the Model

This repository contains code for visualizing robot capability specially wrench polytope capacity of cable driven shoulder joint. The shoulder joint is passive and placed at the center. The cable driven shoulder joint is driven by n+3 cables i.e 3 dof joint driven by 6 cables for more workspace. This could be used in many applications like exoskeletons, tensegrity joints, parallel robots.

# Graphic Mockup

A library of graphical and computational tools has been written in order to simplify the analysis and to provide a sophisticated and effective mockup.
